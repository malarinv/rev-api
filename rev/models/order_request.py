    - For each input, you must provide either uri or external_link, but not both. If both or neither is provided,
    error is returned.
    - You should only provide an external_link if it links to page where the media can be found, rather than directly to
    the media file, and that we will not attempt to do anything with the link when the API call is made.
    This is in contrast to when you post to /inputs with a link to a media file - in that case we do download the file.
    So the external_link should only be used when you can't link to the media file directly.
    - The external_link can contain anything you want, but if it's a YouTube link, we will attempt to determine the
    duration of the video on that page.
    We also allow users of the api to specify if translation should be done using our Verbatim option (:verbatim => true)
